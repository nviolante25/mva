The gradients are set to zero for all classes except the desired class (tiger cat), which is set to 1. This signal is then backpropagated to the `rectified convolutional feature map` of interest, where we can compute the coarse Grad-CAM localization (blue heatmap).\n","\n","\n","* **To Do**: Define your own function Grad_CAM to achieve the visualization of the given images. For each image, choose the top-3 possible labels as the desired classes. Compare the heatmaps of the three classes, and conclude. \n","\n","\n","* **Hints**: \n"," + We need to record the output and grad_output of the feature maps to achieve Grad-CAM. In pytorch, the function `Hook` is defined for this purpose. Read the tutorial of [hook](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/former_torchies/nnft_tutorial.html#forward-and-backward-function-hooks) carefully. \n"," + The pretrained model resnet34 doesn't have an activation function after its last layer, the output is indeed the `raw class scores`, you can use them directly. \n"," + The size of feature maps is 7x7, so your heatmap will have the same size. You need to project the heatmap to the resized image (224x224, not the original one, before the normalization) to have a better observation. The function [`torch.nn.functional.interpolate`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.functional.html?highlight=interpolate#torch.nn.functional.interpolate) may help.  \n"," + Here is the link of the paper [Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391.pdf)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qZnb3iifYsxV"},"source":["![Grad-CAM](https://da2so.github.io/assets/post_img/2020-08-10-GradCAM/2.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Implementation"],"metadata":{"id":"Fg5atNM3z4iB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from functools import partial\n","import random\n","\n","class GradCAM():\n","    def __init__(self, model):\n","        # Trained model\n","        self.model = model\n","        # Internal variables for storing activations and gradients with hooks\n","        self.activations = []\n","        self.gradients = []\n","        # Registering hooks to retain useful values\n","        self.model.layer4[-1].conv2.register_forward_hook(self.save_activations)\n","        self.model.layer4[-1].conv2.register_full_backward_hook(self.save_gradients)\n","\n","    def save_activations(self, model, layer_input, layer_output):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Save the k activations maps A^k\n","        \"\"\"\n","        self.activations = layer_output.data\n","\n","\n","    def save_gradients(self, model, grad_input, grad_output):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Save the k gradients dy^c/dA^k\n","        \"\"\"\n","        self.gradients = grad_output[0]\n","\n","\n","    def compute_top_3(self, image):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Computes the 3 GradCAMs associated to the top 3 possible classes\n","        \"\"\"\n","        # Forward pass\n","        output = self.model(image)\n","        # Select top 3 classes\n","        _, indices = torch.topk(output, 3)\n","        # Save GradCAMs\n","        heatmaps = []\n","        predicted_labels = []\n","        for top_k in range(3):\n","            idx = indices[0][top_k]\n","            # Computes the gradient of the prediction of the class of interest c\n","            output[0, idx].backward(retain_graph=True)\n","            # GradCAM weights computed by average pooling\n","            weights = torch.nn.AvgPool2d(self.gradients.shape[-2:])(self.gradients)\n","            # GradCAM computation by averaging activations + ReLU\n","            heatmap = torch.relu(torch.sum(self.activations * weights, 1))\n","            # Upscaling heatmap\n","            heatmap = nn.functional.interpolate(heatmap[None, ...], image.shape[-2:], mode=\"bilinear\")\n","            heatmaps.append(heatmap[0,0,...])\n","            predicted_labels.append(idx.item())\n","        return heatmaps, predicted_labels"],"metadata":{"id":"QcxAcyBgfIQd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["resnet34 = models.resnet34(pretrained=True)\n","resnet34.eval() # set the model to evaluation mode\n","grad_cam = GradCAM(resnet34)"],"metadata":{"id":"rXV6navB0Hkx"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Visualization and comments"],"metadata":{"id":"5iAd35Mjz90G"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for image_index in range(len(dataset)):\n","    heatmaps, predicted_labels = grad_cam.compute_top_3(dataset[image_index][0].view(1, 3, 224, 224))\n","    img = Image.open(dataset.imgs[image_index][0]).convert('RGB')\n","    img = img.resize((224,224))\n","    plt.figure(figsize=(15,5))\n","    for i in range(len(heatmaps)):\n","        plt.subplot(1,3,+i+1)\n","        plt.imshow(img)\n","        plt.title(classes[predicted_labels[i]])\n","        plt.imshow(heatmaps[i], alpha=0.5)"],"metadata":{"id":"2GxCYHIb87Bh"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In the majority of the images (around 14) the activation maps for the top-3 predicted classes are really similar.
